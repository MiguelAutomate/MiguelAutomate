# Miguel Automate

## AI Red Teamer & Automation Architect - **[Portfolio Website](https://miguelautomate.com/)**


## About Me

I'm an AI Red Teamer and Automation Architect who specializes in stress-testing generative AI systems at scale. My work sits at the critical intersection where AI innovation meets enterprise security—identifying breaking points in logic, leaks in data flows, and vulnerabilities in orchestration layers before they become business-critical incidents.

Unlike traditional security approaches, I employ an adversarial mindset from day one, ensuring that as businesses scale with LLMs, they don't sacrifice security or operational integrity. I begin every engagement with a deep forensic dive into existing business processes, pinpointing manual, repetitive, or error-prone tasks that create attack surfaces, then architect bespoke automation solutions primarily using Python.

My philosophy rejects one-size-fits-all platforms. Instead, I craft tailored software that integrates seamlessly with current systems while hardening them against emerging AI-specific threats. I specialize in comprehensive AI red teaming for audit reports, systematically testing for jailbreaks, prompt injection vectors, data poisoning pathways, and insecure output handling in complex RAG pipelines. The outcome is always clear, actionable findings that transform theoretical vulnerabilities into concrete hardening strategies.

## Core Expertise

* **Adversarial Testing for LLM Systems:** Black-box audits of AI agents, multi-agent systems, and orchestration layers using evidence-first methodology (TRACE → BREACH → IMPACT → PROOF). I don't just find vulnerabilities—I demonstrate their business impact through reproducible attack chains.

* **Prompt Injection & RAG Risk Analysis:** Deep forensic analysis of vulnerability vectors in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, context injection points, and intent-drift exploitation. I map trust boundaries and identify where data flows break down.

* **Agent Architecture & Trust Boundaries:** Specialized in identifying breakdowns in agent-to-agent handoffs, tool authorization failures, and escalation pathways in autonomous systems. I design systems where security is intrinsic, not bolted on.

* **AI Security & Hardening:** Proven mitigation strategies for jailbreaks, data poisoning, output manipulation, and insecure delegations in multi-agent workflows. I translate theoretical risks into practical security controls.

* **Bespoke Automation Solutions:** Custom Python-based automation systems designed to streamline operations while maintaining enterprise-grade security and auditability standards. I build what off-the-shelf solutions can't.

* **Cloud & DevSecOps:** Architecting secure, scalable cloud solutions (AWS, Azure, GCP) with infrastructure-as-code principles and security-first practices. I ensure automation scales without creating new attack surfaces.

## What I Do & How I Deliver Value


* **Red Team Your AI Agents:** I conduct comprehensive black-box audits of your LLM-powered systems, exposing critical vulnerabilities before attackers do. My independent, evidence-backed findings come with reproducible Proofs-of-Concept that demonstrate real business impact, not just theoretical risks.

* **Evidence-First Reporting:** Every finding follows the TRACE → BREACH → IMPACT → PROOF methodology, paired with a trust-boundary map and OWASP LLM Top 10 alignment. I deliver actionable remediation steps that your team can implement immediately, not just vulnerability lists.

* **Secure Agent Architecture:** I design intrinsically safer multi-agent systems with proper intent verification, granular tool authorization, and auditability built into orchestration layers from the ground up. My architectures prevent vulnerabilities rather than just detecting them.

* **Build Resilient Automation:** I architect bespoke automation solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure while maintaining security posture and operational transparency. My automations work for your business, not against it.

* **Custom Security Frameworks:** I develop tailored security automation frameworks that leverage AI for threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response within your specific operational context. I build what you need, not what's available.
